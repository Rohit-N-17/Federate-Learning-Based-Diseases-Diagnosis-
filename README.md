# Federate-Learning-Based-Diseases-Diagnosis-
The Federated Learning Based Disease Diagnosis project aims to develop a privacy-preserving, collaborative AI framework that enables hospitals, clinics, and medical research centers to train disease diagnosis models without sharing sensitive patient data.

---

## 📘 Overview
The **Federated Learning System** is a decentralized machine learning framework that enables multiple clients (devices, organizations, or nodes) to collaboratively train a shared global model without directly sharing their raw data.  
Instead of transferring sensitive datasets to a central server, only **model updates (gradients or weights)** are exchanged and aggregated, preserving privacy and improving security.

This approach is ideal for domains such as **healthcare, finance, IoT, and mobile devices**, where **data confidentiality** is essential but collaborative intelligence is valuable.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To design and implement a **privacy-preserving, distributed learning framework** that:
- Allows clients to train local models independently.  
- Aggregates the parameters into a global model on a central server.  
- Enhances accuracy while ensuring no raw data is exchanged.  
- Demonstrates the feasibility of **federated learning** using real or simulated datasets.

---

## 💡 Problem Statement
Traditional machine learning approaches rely on **centralized data aggregation**, which poses significant challenges:
- Privacy and security risks  
- Compliance issues with data regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)  
- High communication costs and data transfer latency  
- Lack of fairness due to uneven data distributions across clients  

This project addresses these issues through a **Federated Learning** framework, ensuring collaborative training while preserving **data locality and privacy**.

## 🧠 Concept of Federated Learning

Federated Learning operates on the principle of **"bringing the code to the data"** rather than moving data to a central server.

### Workflow:
1. The server initializes a **global model** and shares it with all participating clients.  
2. Each client trains the model on its **local dataset**.  
3. Clients send **updated model weights** (not data) to the central server.  
4. The server aggregates these updates using algorithms like **Federated Averaging (FedAvg)**.  
5. The process repeats over multiple rounds until convergence.
