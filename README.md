## 📘 Overview
The **Federated Learning Based Disease Diagnosis** project aims to develop a **privacy-preserving, collaborative AI framework** that enables hospitals, clinics, and medical research institutions to collaboratively train machine learning models **without sharing sensitive patient data**.

This system uses **Federated Learning (FL)** — a decentralized training paradigm where multiple nodes (clients) contribute to the model training process **while keeping their datasets local**. Instead of uploading patient records to a centralized server, only **model updates** (parameters, gradients, or weights) are transmitted securely to an aggregator, ensuring complete data privacy and compliance with regulations such as **GDPR** and **HIPAA**.

By applying this technique, medical institutions can build more accurate disease diagnosis systems that leverage **diverse, distributed healthcare datasets** — without compromising confidentiality.

## 🎯 Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:

- 🩺 To build a **distributed federated learning framework** for medical diagnosis.  
- 🔒 To preserve **patient data privacy** while allowing collaborative model training.  
- ⚙️ To simulate **multi-client training environments** for different hospitals or medical units.  
- 📊 To evaluate federated models against traditional centralized approaches.  
- 🧠 To analyze model convergence, performance, and communication efficiency.

The ultimate goal is to demonstrate how **privacy-aware AI** can be applied effectively in the **healthcare domain**, enabling secure data collaboration and better diagnostic outcomes.

## 💡 Problem Statement
In traditional machine learning workflows, all data must be collected and stored centrally before training the model.  
However, in **medical domains**, this approach introduces several challenges:

1. ⚠️ **Privacy and Confidentiality Risks** – Patient health data is highly sensitive. Sharing it externally violates ethical and legal boundaries.  
2. 🧾 **Regulatory Compliance** – Laws such as **HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation) restrict raw data movement.  
3. 💽 **High Communication Overhead** – Transferring large healthcare datasets increases bandwidth and latency.  
4. 🧩 **Data Heterogeneity** – Hospitals may have different devices, data types, and patient demographics.  
5. ⚖️ **Unbalanced Datasets** – Some medical centers may have more patient records than others, leading to biased model training.

The **Federated Learning-Based Disease Diagnosis** framework solves these problems by keeping the data **local** while still benefiting from **collective intelligence**.

## 🧠 Concept of Federated Learning
Federated Learning (FL) is a **collaborative training approach** where a global model is trained across multiple devices or organizations without requiring data centralization.

### 🏗️ Workflow:
1. **Server Initialization** – A central coordinator initializes a global ML model.  
2. **Model Distribution** – The model is sent to all participating clients (e.g., hospitals).  
3. **Local Training** – Each client trains the model on its own private dataset.  
4. **Model Update** – Clients send updated weights to the server, **not raw data**.  
5. **Federated Aggregation (FedAvg)** – The server averages the updates to improve the global model.  
6. **Iteration** – The updated global model is redistributed for the next training round.  

This process repeats until the global model converges and achieves high accuracy.
